You must provide us with basic profile info from your RIT google account and other personal information. This information contains your name, email address, and phone number. Other personal details about yourself are also asked about, and all of this information is optional; however, in order to utilize the features of the service, you must provide some personal information. Information of this type may include personal preferences, sexual orientation, interests, and personality details. **None** of this information is publicly available, but you may allow matches to see some of your information. **None** of the information you provide tigermeet.space is given or sold to any third-parties, it all stays within the service.

##How the Information is Handled
All information provided by you is stored for your benefit. The website uses a complex algorithm to compare your information with other users trying to find matches. Based on the preferences you specify, you can get personalized matches to other people you are interested in dating, people you are interested in befriending, and organizations that you might be interested in joining. The algorithm will show you matches that you got; however, no personal information is transferred to either party in a match until one authorizes the other to see it.

##Tracking
